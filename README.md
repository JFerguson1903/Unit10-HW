## Description

I was given the assignment through Triliogy/WASHU Coding Bootcamp to "build a software engineering team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.". The user story was that, "As a manager I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles".
